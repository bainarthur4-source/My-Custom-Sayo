As far as I'm aware everything will work with 6 screws 4 for the lid and 2 for the board. Potentially if I use 2 screws for the lid and 2 for the board I will only need 4 M3 bolts

Firmware:
I used QMK with the first key as W for jump in GD, and the other 2 keys are copy and paste.
Pressing the rotary encoder will mute and scrolling up and down will make volume go up and down.
